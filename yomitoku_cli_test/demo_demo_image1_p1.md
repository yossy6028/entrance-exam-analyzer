sponding OR of non\-Hodgkin Iymphoma was 1.18 \(95% CI 0.95\-<br>1.46\): also for this group of lymphoma, no trend was apparent for<br>any indicator of exposure.

When the analysiss on non\-Hodgkin lymphoma was repeated for<br>specific types of meat \(Table III\), the OR for ever exposure to<br>beef meat was 1.22 \(95% CI 0.95\-1.67\), and the OR for ever ex\-<br>posure to chicken meat was 1.19 \(95% CI 0.91\-1.55\). The remain\-<br>ing meat types, namely pork meat and mutton meat. showed either<br>no effect or small nonsignificant increases in lymphoma nsk. Ex\-<br>posure for more than 15 years to beef meat resulted in an OR of<br>1.63 \(95% CI 0.993\-2.88\). An increase in risk was also observed

for long\-term exposure to chicken meat \(OR = 1.36, 95% CI<br>0.90\-2.06\). The results on intensity of exposure did not suggest a<br>difference among meat types.

In the analyses stratified by lymphoma type, whose results are<br>reported in Table IV, an increased risk among workers exposed to<br>beef meat was mainly apparent for diffuse large B\-cell lymphoma<br>\(OR = 1.49, 95%CI 0.96\-2.33\), chronic lymphocyic ie teukemia/<br>small lymphocytic Iymphoma \(OR = 1.35, 95% CI 0.78\-2.34\),<br>and multtple myeloma \(OR = 1.40, 95%CI 0.67\-2.94\). Stronger<br>increases in risk were observed for each of these 3 subtypes after<br>16 years or more of exposure \(OR 2.00, 95% C1 0.87\-4.61; OR
